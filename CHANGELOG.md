versioning follows the scheme in `docs/VERSIONING.md`.

## [Unreleased]

### Planned
- Layer 0 — foundation: config, `AppError`, logging, single-instance, CLI skeleton

---

## [0.1.0] — 2026-08-24

First versioned state of the project. Environment and plan only; no application code yet.

### Added
- `install.ps1` — automated Windows installer, self-locating, with per-step
  **[R]etry / [C]ontinue / [A]bort** prompting on failure
- `requirements.txt` — dependency pins re-verified against PyPI, all with Windows wheels
- `doctor.py` — environment verification with a remediation for every failure;
  `--json` and `--quick` modes; required vs optional check distinction
- `BUILD_SPEC_V2.md` — layer-by-layer build plan (L0–L9) with acceptance tests,
  SQLite and LanceDB schemas, module layout, and a per-stage performance budget
- `app/` package skeleton matching the build spec, with layer ownership recorded in
  every module docstring
- `app/core/version.py` — single source of truth for the version, read from `VERSION`
- Versioning: `VERSION`, `CHANGELOG.md`, `docs/VERSIONING.md`, `.gitignore`, `.env.example`
- `tests/` skeleton with fixture folders for healthy and deliberately corrupt files

### Fixed
Faults found by the first real installer run, corrected rather than worked around:

- **`Install Git` failed with exit code `-1978335189`.** winget returns
  `UPDATE_NOT_APPLICABLE` when a package is already installed and current — not a failure.
  Every install step now carries a `-Verify` block; if the command works afterwards, the
  exit code is ignored.
- **`Could not open requirements file`.** The installer created a subfolder, `Set-Location`'d
  into it, and looked for files that were never there — and because it had been launched from
  `C:\Windows\system32`, that is where the project landed. The project folder is now the
  script's own folder (`$PSScriptRoot`), and `requirements.txt` and `doctor.py` are checked
  for in preflight before anything is installed.
- **Both model downloads raised tracebacks.** Pure cascade: pip never ran, so `fastembed`
  was not importable. Package install is a required step and now aborts by default.
- **`ollama pull mistral` stalled on `pulling manifest`.** A freshly installed Ollama has no
  service listening. The step now waits up to 60s for `127.0.0.1:11434`, starting
  `ollama serve` if needed, before pulling.
- **`doctor.py` was run from the wrong directory** and could not be found. Absolute paths
  throughout; `Push-Location`/`Pop-Location` around anything that must change directory.
- **Braille progress spinners rendered as `â ‹`.** Console output encoding is now set to UTF-8.
- **`continue` inside a `switch` inside a `while`** continued the switch, not the loop, so
  "Retry" would not have retried. Replaced with `if`/`elseif`.
- **`.env` was written with a UTF-8 BOM** by PS 5.1's `Set-Content -Encoding UTF8`, which
  breaks some `.env` parsers. Now written BOM-free.

### Changed
- **Dependency pins refreshed.** The draft pins were indicative and badly stale — notably
  `fastembed==0.4.2`, which predates the current `TextCrossEncoder` rerank API:
  PyQt6 6.7.1→6.11.0, lancedb 0.15.0→0.37.1, fastembed 0.4.2→0.8.0,
  pymupdf 1.24.10→1.28.2, python-docx 1.1.2→1.2.0, pywin32 306→312,
  networkx 3.3→3.6.1, pydantic 2.9.2→2.13.4, python-dotenv 1.0.1→1.2.3,
  loguru 0.7.2→0.7.3, tqdm 4.66.5→4.70.0, requests 2.32.3→2.34.2.
  Verified by round-trip, not just version number.
- **Free-space check reconciled.** The installer demanded 150GB while `doctor.py` checked
  for 250GB against the *current directory*. Both now check the drive holding `DATA_PATH`
  against 150GB, overridable via `-RequiredFreeGB`.
- **Model cache location made explicit.** Both `FASTEMBED_CACHE_PATH` and the `cache_dir=`
  constructor argument are set, so models cannot silently land in the user profile instead
  of the index drive.
- V1's layered build plan superseded — it assumed FastAPI, PostgreSQL and Qdrant.
